This directory contains two configuration files that enable you to
build and run lfric_atm from the command line. These files are
colloquially called the "canned" configurations.

To use them, check out a working copy of a branch. Then:

$ cd r12345_workingCopy/lfric_atm 
$ make build ;# Builds lfric_atm and copies it to bin directory
<snip lots of output>
$ cd example
$ ../bin/lfric_atm configuration.nml ;# Runs lfric_atm with the configuration file as input

configuration.nml
----------------- 

This file configures a "single column" run of lfric_atm. In reality,
the mesh is a 4x4 biperiodic mesh, though each column will be
identical. The configuration was originally copied from the Rose Stem
"run_lfric_atm_scm_bl" configuration, but note that the Rose Stem
version may diverge from this configuration as the two are not
actively kept in line.

This configuration is tested to ensure it runs successfully, as part
of the developer test within the canned-test application. Therefore it
is always expected to successfully run to completion.

aquaplanet_configuration.nml
----------------------------

This file configures global run of lfric_atm. The configuration was
originally copied from the Rose Stem "lfric_atm_aquaplanet_short"
configuration configuration. Note that Rose Stem version may diverge
from this configuration as the two are not actively kept in line.

This configuration is NOT tested routinely as part of the developer
test, and therefore there is a high risk that it will become
broken. If you find that it no longer works, please report it to the
LFRic team.

If you wish to run a global configuration and this one does not work,
you can create a working based on one of the Rose Stem configurations.
