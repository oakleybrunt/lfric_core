  !>@details This file sets many parameters and switches which are currently
  !>          in the Jules namelists. Many of these will never be promoted to
  !>          the LFRic namelist as they are legacy options not fit for future
  !>          use. Hence we set them here until such time as we can retire them
  !>          from the Jules code.
  !>        Other parameters and switches which are genuinely input variables,
  !>         via the LFRic namelists, are also set here for the Jules code.
  !>       Where possible, all values are taken from GL7 science settings.
